# Food Diet Planner using ML Clustering

This project is a **machine learning-based diet planner** that uses **KMeans clustering** to group users based on their nutritional profiles and suggest personalized diet plans.

## 📌 Features
- Uses the `nutrition_dataset_github.csv` dataset containing:
  - Age
  - Height
  - Weight
  - BMI
  - Activity level
- Performs clustering using **KMeans** to segment users into dietary categories
- Visualizes clusters and user distribution
- Helps understand user health patterns through unsupervised learning
- Built and executed in **Google Colab**

## 📁 Files in this Repository
- `ml_diet_planner_with_clustering.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook with preprocessing, clustering, and visualization
- `nutrition_dataset_github.csv`: Dataset used for training and clustering

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `nutrition_dataset_github.csv` or load from repo
3. Run all cells to see cluster formation and user classification
4. Modify or expand features to improve clustering accuracy

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
- Add classification for diet type prediction
- Integrate a user input form or interface
- Use additional features like dietary restrictions or goals

## 🗂️ Use Case
Helpful for fitness/diet apps to automatically group users and recommend plans based on health metrics.
